The Canadian farm industry is a multibillion dollar a year industry which needs to provide for a growing human population, high production of grain requires farmers to dry and store the grains that they grow, however this introduces problems such as possible spoilage of the grain as well as proper humidity control. Spoilage and water has dielectric properties which are different of those that dry good grain has, therefore these anomalies can be detected with the use of a microwave imaging system which consists of a Vector Network Analyzer, a 2xN RF multiplexer, an N array of antennas and a computer for collecting and analyzing the scattered parameters to create a three dimensional image of a material. However typical microwave imaging systems are very costly and complex which does not provide a feasible solution for farmers as such systems can cost in the magnitude of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The goal of our project is to create a system that is capable of acquiring the required scattering parameters for imaging a grain bin. Our system consists of a low cost Vector Network Analyzer, a redesigned low cost RF switch, an array of electric and magnetic field antennas and a controller for collecting data and automating the process so that the entire system would be as affordable and as user friendly as possible thus making it a feasible product to be used by farmers out in the field.
